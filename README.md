## Schematics

Cant exactly store priv key in smart contract so the current idea will be:

Smart Contract:
1. Receive funds from the user.
2. Validate and allocate the dynamic mint price and extra amount??
3. Emit some event to notify your backend of valid txn???
N. Allow withdrawls: Make sure my wallet can wirthdraw funds from the contract.  

Backend:
1. Listen for validated event
2. Run Mint script
3. Wait for the minting transaction to confirm and transfer minted NFT to the user.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
